# Environment Monitoring System

In 2023 I created a primitive environment monitoring system using esp2388 micro-controllers and a banana pi (Raspberry pis were hard to source then). However, that repo has been lost through computer transitions. This project is a not-so-faithful reconstruction, in that I'm using esp32s (i currently have more on hand), and will be bringing new programming and deployment concepts that I've learned over that period of time.
